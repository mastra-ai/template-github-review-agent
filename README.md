# GitHub PR Code Review Agent

An AI-powered code review agent built with [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) that analyzes any GitHub pull request and returns detailed feedback directly in chat. It uses a structured workflow, workspace skills for review standards, and adaptive review depth based on PR size.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 22.13.0
- pnpm
- A [GitHub Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) (read-only scope)
- An [Anthropic API Key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

## Setup

```shell
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your `.env`:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

## Usage

Start the dev server:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) to access Mastra Studio.

### Agent (Chat)

Open the **GitHub PR Code Reviewer** agent and give it a PR URL:

```
Review this PR: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
```

The agent (Claude Opus) will fetch the PR, adaptively page through files based on PR size, and return a structured review. It handles small, medium, and large PRs differently to stay within context limits.

### Workflow

Open the **Workflows** tab and run **pr-review-workflow** with `owner`, `repo`, and `pullNumber` inputs. The workflow runs a fixed 4-step pipeline and returns a structured JSON review.

## Customization

### Change Review Standards

Edit the files in `workspace/skills/` to match your team's conventions. The `SKILL.md` files define the review process; the `references/` files provide detailed checklists.

### Adjust Thresholds

Edit `src/mastra/lib/review-config.ts`:

- `SMALL_PR_MAX` / `MEDIUM_PR_MAX` — PR size breakpoints for adaptive review depth.
- `MAX_CONTENT_CHARS_PER_FILE` / `MAX_PATCH_CHARS_PER_FILE` — Per-file truncation limits.
- `SKIP_PATTERNS` — Regex patterns for files to skip during review.

### Swap Models

Change the `model` field in the agent files. The code-review-agent uses Opus for quality; the workflow-review-agent uses Haiku for speed. Any Anthropic model works, or switch to another provider supported by Mastra.

## Deployment

```shell
pnpm run build
pnpm run start
```

Or deploy to [Mastra Cloud](https://cloud.mastra.ai/) — see the [deployment guide](https://mastra.ai/docs/deployment/overview).
